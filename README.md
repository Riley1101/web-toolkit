# web-toolkit

This is a work in progress web toolkit using GTK's default theme, Adwaita.

## Why

All UI design frameworks suck. No one knows how to design. Except for Gnome designers
strangely.  And maybe Apple too, but they're not in the OSS business so I avoid them.

## Roadmap

The first goal is to port Adwaita.css for web usage, which means removing every GTK+ CSS
proprietary quirks.

The second goal is to create components to make it easy to use the framework. For now the
demo components are being created with React but I've been thinking about making a Solid
version. But the first goal should allow any UI framework to reuse the CSS classes.

## Contribution

Help me please. This is going to be great.
